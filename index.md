Welcome to the MetalFury Dev Blog!  Here I will be doing three things:

1. Documenting the MetalFury engine. This will allow for future developers to create their own games off of this platform.
2. Documenting the MetalFury's development journey. This is a big project, and I'd like to have a historic record of its ups, and downs.
3. Provide updates on the development of Pacific Fury, the first game built on the MetalFury engine.
