# üõ†Ô∏è The MetalFury Manifesto: A Design Philosophy for Game Engines

## Purpose
**MetalFury is not a codebase‚Äîit‚Äôs a philosophy for building powerful, sustainable, and adaptable game engines.**  
It is built to empower the creation of complex, simulation-rich, and system-driven games with clarity, speed, and control.

This manifesto defines the core principles of MetalFury, independent of any specific language, framework, or implementation.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 1. Modular by Nature
Every system should be a self-contained unit, independently testable, replaceable, and composable.  
- No module should assume the presence or shape of another.  
- Clear, narrow interfaces define cooperation between systems.  
- The engine is a *collection of small, sharp tools*, not a single monolith.

> ‚ÄúTightly coupled code rots. Loosely coupled systems evolve.‚Äù

---

## ‚ö° 2. Performance as a First-Class Citizen
Performance is not an optimization‚Äîit‚Äôs a design constraint.  
- Prioritize cache efficiency, data-oriented design, and lightweight communication.  
- Avoid hidden costs. Favor transparency over ease when ease hides complexity.

> ‚ÄúPredictable is better than magical.‚Äù

---

## üîÑ 3. Compile-Time by Default, Runtime When It Matters
- Prefer static configuration, structural typing, and early validation.  
- Use dynamic behavior where runtime flexibility is essential (e.g. scripting, plugins).  
- Everything should be opt-in, not imposed.

> ‚ÄúDesign for control, not convenience.‚Äù

---

## üîÅ 4. Extendable and Replaceable at Every Layer
From input to rendering to AI to simulation, every core system must be swappable.  
- The engine owns no assumptions about your game‚Äôs architecture.  
- Custom logic and systems are not "hacks"‚Äîthey are *first-class citizens*.

> ‚ÄúThe engine should shape to the game, not the other way around.‚Äù

---

## üß™ 5. Built for Testing, Always
If it can‚Äôt be tested, it can‚Äôt be trusted.  
- Every module should be independently verifiable.  
- No single path through the engine should be required to validate behavior.  
- Automated builds and tests are non-negotiable.

> ‚ÄúA game engine is not just for running games‚Äîit‚Äôs for testing them.‚Äù

---

## üß± 6. Entity-Component-System as Foundation, Not Dogma
Entity-Component-System (ECS) is favored for its flexibility and scalability, but:
- Use ECS because it fits the problem‚Äînot because it‚Äôs trendy.
- Design ECS around clarity and decoupling, not around theoretical purity.
- Prefer systems that **express game logic cleanly**, even if it means bending the model.

> ‚ÄúThe architecture serves the game. Not the other way around.‚Äù

---

## üîß 7. Tools are Core, Not Optional
An engine is not complete without tooling.  
- Editors, debuggers, visualizers, profilers‚Äîthese are part of the engine, not accessories.  
- Tooling must consume the same APIs the game does. No hidden backdoors.

> ‚ÄúIf a system can‚Äôt be inspected, it can‚Äôt be trusted. If it can‚Äôt be edited, it can‚Äôt be improved.‚Äù

---

## üì¶ 8. One Engine, Many Use Cases
MetalFury is not a one-game engine. It must adapt across genres, styles, and timelines:  
- Abstract assumptions (e.g. rendering, input, data) into interfaces.  
- Make scripting and configuration language-agnostic where possible.  
- License, extend, or embed without rewriting the core.

> ‚ÄúWhat you build today should empower what you build tomorrow.‚Äù

---

## üß† 9. Thoughtful Over Clever
Avoid premature abstraction, over-optimization, or magical behavior.  
- Favor simple systems with deep leverage.  
- Readability, predictability, and maintainability win over cleverness.

> ‚ÄúThe best engine is one you don‚Äôt have to think about while using.‚Äù

---

## ‚è≥ 10. Designed to Outlive Its Creators
An engine‚Äôs value isn‚Äôt in what it runs today‚Äîbut in how gracefully it evolves.  
- Design for human change: new contributors, new platforms, new games.  
- Build documentation into the process.  
- Leave room for growth, iteration, and reinvention.

> ‚ÄúIf you stop working on it, it should still be usable. If someone else picks it up, they should understand it.‚Äù

---

## MetalFury Is a Promise
To yourself. To your games. To your future collaborators.  
A promise that the tools you build will empower rather than constrain.  
A promise that good design, clear thinking, and strong architecture will last longer than trends.

**MetalFury is not the code. MetalFury is the clarity behind the code.**
